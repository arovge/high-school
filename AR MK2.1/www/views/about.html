<p id="paragraphText">Austin Rovge is a 17 year old junior in high school. He has absolutely no idea what he's doing in life, but plans to go into computers. He suffers from anxiety and from prolonged exposure to 'dank memes'. This is a bit more text just so I can test the overflow on my front page. He is currently going to be the 'lead' of the Web Apps CDT for his Robotics team. He is currently spending his summer getting pissed at CSGO casuals, upgrading his PC, and doing his AP Physics homework, filled with memes from 9gag. Really Weiss?</p>
